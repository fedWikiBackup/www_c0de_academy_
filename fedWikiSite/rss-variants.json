This behavior has become expected of readers, to the point of becoming a [[de facto]] standard, though there is still some inconsistency in how software handles this markup, particularly in titles. The RSS 2.0 specification was later updated to include examples of entity-encoded HTML; however, all prior plain text usages remain valid."

This RSS was called ''[[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] Site Summary'', but was based on an early working draft of the RDF standard, and was not compatible with the final RDF Recommendation.\n- RSS 1.0 is an open format by the [[RSS-DEV Working Group]], again standing for ''RDF Site Summary''. RSS 1.0 is an RDF format like RSS 0.90, but not fully compatible with it, since 1.0 is based on the final RDF 1.0 Recommendation.\n- RSS 1.1 is also an open format and is intended to update and replace RSS 1.0. The specification is an independent draft not supported or endorsed in any way by the RSS-Dev Working Group or any other organization.\n- RSS 0.91 is the simplified RSS version released by Netscape, and also the version number of the simplified version originally championed by [[Dave Winer]] from Userland Software. The Netscape version was now called ''Rich Site Summary''; this was no longer an RDF format, but was relatively easy to use.\n- RSS 0.92 through 0.94 are expansions of the RSS 0.91 format, which are mostly compatible with each other and with Winer's version of RSS 0.91, but are not compatible with RSS 0.90.\n- RSS 2.0.1 has the internal version number 2.0. RSS 2.0.1 was proclaimed to be \"frozen\", but still updated shortly after release without changing the version number.  RSS now stood for ''Really Simple Syndication''.  The major change in this version is an explicit extension mechanism using XML namespaces."

Likewise, the RSS 2.* core specification does not support providing full-text in addition to a synopsis, but the RSS 1.* markup can be (and often is) used as an extension.
