      "text": "__GraphQL__ is an open-source data [[query language]] and [[data manipulation language]] language for [[Application programming interface]], and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. GraphQL was developed internally by [[Facebook]] in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.  On 7 November 2018, the GraphQL project was moved from Facebook to the newly-established GraphQL foundation, hosted by the non-profit [[Linux Foundation]] - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL wikipedia]"

      "text": "It provides an efficient, powerful and flexible approach to developing web APIs, and has been compared and contrasted with [[REST]] and other [[web service]] architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server, therefore preventing excessively large amounts of data from being returned, but this has implications for how effective [[Web cache]] of query results can be. The flexibility and richness of the query language also adds complexity that may not be worthwhile for simple APIs."
