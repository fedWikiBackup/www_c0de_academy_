They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated [[Merkle tree]]s to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#History wikipedia]"

The term ''blockchain 2.0'' refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging in 2014. ''[[The Economist]]'' described one implementation of this second-generation programmable blockchain as coming with \"a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level.\""
