Likewise, the RSS 2.* core specification does not support providing full-text in addition to a synopsis, but the RSS 1.* markup can be (and often is) used as an extension.  There are also several common outside extension packages available, e.g. one  from [[Microsoft]] for use in [[Internet Explorer]] 7."

Userland's RSS reader—generally considered as the reference implementation—did not originally filter out [[HTML]] markup from feeds. As a result, publishers began placing HTML markup into the titles and descriptions of items in their RSS feeds. This behavior has become expected of readers, to the point of becoming a [[de facto]] standard, though there is still some inconsistency in how software handles this markup, particularly in titles. The RSS 2.0 specification was later updated to include examples of entity-encoded HTML; however, all prior plain text usages remain valid."
