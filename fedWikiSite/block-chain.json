Each block is also computationally impractical to modify once it has been in the chain for a while because every block after it would also have to be regenerated. These properties are what make bitcoins transactions [[Irreversible Transactions]]. The block chain is the main innovation of Bitcoin."

Whichever block ends up being included in the next block becomes part of the main chain because that chain is longer. More serious forks have occurred after fixing bugs that required backward-incompatible changes."

Whichever block ends up being included in the next block becomes part of the main chain because that chain is longer.
